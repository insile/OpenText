- Too often she betrayed this , by the undue vent she gave to a spiteful antipathy she had conceived against little Adele : pushing her away with some contumelious epithet if she happened to approach her ; sometimes ordering her from the room , and always treating her with coldness and acrimony .
	- 她的弱点经常会暴露无遗，因为她对小阿黛儿心生厌恶，充满敌意，并且无端发泄不满情绪，要是小阿黛儿恰巧走近她，她会用恶毒的词汇把她撵走，有时命令她离开房间，常常冷淡刻毒地对待她。
