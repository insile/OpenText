The way I asked you and The way you replied:
1. use ``` code block to surround markdown text
2. Using code blocks to surround markdown, markdown use Obsidian style, that is say, use "$" in inline math formula, use double "$$" in multi-line formula, etc.
3. If I just use "" to send you text, that mean you need to translate it between chinese and english, or between japanese and chinese.
4. If I send you a garbled copy of Wikipedia with mojibake, please remove the hyperlinks, references, and garbled mojibake formulas, organize the content into markdown blocks, and send them to me.
