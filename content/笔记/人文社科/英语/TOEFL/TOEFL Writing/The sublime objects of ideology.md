The sublime objects of ideology are used to refer to those objects or beliefs that we consider to be central to the meaning of life and the social order, and that are the source of motivation for the functioning of ideology. These sublime objects are both the goal of our pursuit and the source of our desires, but they can never be fully realized or attained.
