Drawing on Lacan's theory, Zizek explains Symptom as the individual's dissonance with society, the way in which the subconscious mind tries to express itself in the manifest consciousness. Symptoms are a sign of the individual's failed attempts to resolve inner conflicts, as well as a key to decoding the structure of the subconscious mind. At the socio-cultural level, symptoms reflect the fundamental contradictions and conflicts of the social structure.

Fantasy in Zizek's theory is the barrier between reality and our desires, and is a key mechanism for maintaining the subject's identity and social order. Fantasy constructs a seemingly complete reality, hiding the cracks and contradictions that exist at the foundation of reality.


齐泽克借鉴拉康的理论，将 "症状 "解释为个人与社会的不和谐，是潜意识试图在显意识中表达自己的方式。症状是个人试图解决内心冲突失败的标志，也是解码潜意识结构的关键。在社会文化层面，症状反映了社会结构的基本矛盾和冲突。

在齐泽克的理论中，幻想是现实与我们欲望之间的屏障，是维持主体身份和社会秩序的关键机制。幻想构建了一个看似完整的现实，掩盖了现实基础上存在的裂缝和矛盾。
